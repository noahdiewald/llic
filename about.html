<p>
This is a weekly forum open to anyone with an interest in logic,
language, information and computation
(LLIC). <a href="http://linguistics.osu.edu">The Ohio State University
Linguistics Department</a> is the official home of this forum, though
given the subject matter, we encourage participation from interested
parties in other departments â€” especially mathematics, computer
science and philosophy. We plan a varied schedule of work in progress
presentations, general discussion and instructional tutorials. We do
not shy away from the technical aspects, so be prepared to learn some
math and theoretical computer science.
